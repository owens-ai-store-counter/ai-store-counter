# üß≠ AI Store Counter Microservice Application

This repository serves as the **central documentation hub** for the ** AI Store Counter Microservice Application** project ‚Äî a Go-based microservice Application designed to count customers entering and leaving retail stores using AI-assisted computer vision.

The route repo contains **project-wide documentation, design notes, and links** to the individual service repositories.
It does **not contain service code**, but rather connects and coordinates all related components.

## üìò Overview

**AI Store Counter Microservice Application** is a modular microservice architecture that processes still frames from in-store cameras to estimate foot traffic.
Each service handles a specific function ‚Äî from frame collection and classification to counting, analytics, and optional customer re-identification.

Core goals:
- Real-time entry/exit detection
- Multi-store headcount management
- Daily counter resets
- Event storage and analytics
- Scalable Azure deployment

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The StoreCounterService ecosystem is designed as a distributed set of Go-based services, deployable to **Azure Service Fabric** or **Kubernetes (AKS)**.
Each service communicates via HTTP/JSON or Azure messaging (Service Bus/Event Hubs).

High-level workflow:
1. **Camera ‚Üí collector-service:** sends still frames or pointers to stored images.
2. **classifier-service:** labels each frame as `front` or `back` of head.
3. **counter-service:** interprets labelled events and updates per-store counters.
4. **analytics-service:** aggregates data for reporting and dashboards.
5. **location-service-api:** provides configuration and metadata for each store location.
